# Expected Deliverables

## Migration Script:
A migration script that performs a schema change across all schemas.

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
The configuration for a CI/CD pipeline that automates the database migration process.

## Documentation:
A brief documentation explaining their choice of migration tool, steps to run the setup, and how the CI/CD pipeline works.



# Notes
The `.github/workflows/migration.yml` file already includes the necessary steps to build and run the MySQL container and output the current schemas. The container is named `mysql-db` and is exposed on port 3306 within the Github Actions environment.
